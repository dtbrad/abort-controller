This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Instructions
`npm start` starts up react on port 3000 and two fake backend server ports on 3001 and 3002 to mimic slow and fast responses. Entering input value of 'az' hits the fast port (and returns no options) while any other value hits the slow port. See `input.js`, `db.json` and `package.json` for more detail.
